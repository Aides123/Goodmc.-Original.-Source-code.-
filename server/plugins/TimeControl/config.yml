# TimeControl by Alex_qp
# By using this plugin you can control the daycycle of minecraft. 
# IMPORTANT: This plugin will change the gamerule 'doDaylightCycle' of all affected worlds to false! If you do not want a world to be ever affected use the option below. Re-enabling the gamerule will cause logic bugs.

# Set day- and nighttime as well as day-starts-at and standard-day-length in ticks.
# IMPORTANT: The values for day- and night-time will be the actual length of a day / night. All other configurations are just for shifting the time of a normal minecraft day (see the note below).
# IMPORTANT: day-starts-at and standard-day-length are related to the default minecraft ticks.
# Note: If you mess up by creating logical issues with these settings you will be informed in the console and the plugin will use default values (also displayed there).
# Note: day-starts-at and standard-day-length determine the length of a normal minecraft day (light level). You may want to change these if you think at 0 ticks it is still to dark for you to call it a day. If you are fine with the day being from 0-12000 ticks (as stated in the wiki) do not change these values. Again, it has nothing to do with the actual length of the day/night!
day-time: 26000
night-time: 9000
day-starts-at: 0
standard-day-length: 40000
allow-sleep: true

# Set the delay between two time updates in ticks.
# Note: Value 0 is not allowed. Again the plugin will use a standard value instead.
check-delay: 5

# Choose whether or not you want to deactivate worlds with no players.
# Note: This can be useful if you want your live map to be synched. If set to false it takes up more RAM.
# Note: If set to false empty worlds will not change their time state.
deactivate-empty-worlds: true

# List of worlds you do NOT want to be ever affected.
world-exceptions:
  #- world
  #- world_nether
  #- world_the_end

# Choose what world environments you want to exclude entirely.
world-environments:
  normal: false
  nether: true
  the_end: true
